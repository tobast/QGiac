Dependancies:
	- GIAC : http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac_compile.html
		* I recommend using the "latest evolving source"
		* Headers files shall be placed in a "giac" subdir in your compiler's "include" directory
		* QGiac is statically linked, .a file(s) are needed.
	- KLatexFormula : http://klatexformula.sourceforge.net/
		* Please refer to http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt_and_LaTeX_via_KLFBackend for compiling procedure - you do not need to compile the GUI
		* QGiac needs every header file in src/klfbackend, libklftools.a and libklfbackend.a
		* Headers files shall be placed in a "klfbackend" subdir of your compiler's "include" directory

When you have satisfied the above dependancies, you can compile QGiac :

* Linux/unix:
	$ qmake (qmake-qt4 on some OS)
	$ make

* Windows
	$ qmake
	$ mingw32-make
