Dependancies:
	- GIAC : http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac_compile.html
		* I recommend using the "latest evolving source"
		* Headers files shall be placed in a "giac" subdir in your compiler's
		  "include" directory
		* QGiac is statically linked, .a file(s) are needed.
	- [LATEX RENDERING ONLY] KLatexFormula : http://klatexformula.sourceforge.net/
		* Please refer to http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt_and_LaTeX_via_KLFBackend for
		  compiling procedure - you do not need to compile the GUI
		* QGiac needs every header file in src/klfbackend, libklftools.a and
		  libklfbackend.a
		* Headers files shall be placed in a "klfbackend" subdir of your compiler's
		  "include" directory

You can then select between LaTeX and MathML rendering of the results.
I personally recommand using MathML rendering, as it is really quicker : LaTeX
rendering implies calling an external LaTeX compiler, and takes a lot of time
(couple of seconds, sometimes) during which the equation is displayed as text.

To select it, edit the project file (QGiac.pro) and comment/uncomment the lines
include(disp_[rendername].pro)
Beware! If you include more than one rendering file, you will not be able to
build.

When you have satisfied the above dependancies, you can compile QGiac :

* Linux/unix:
	$ qmake (qmake-qt4 on some OS)
	$ make

* Windows
	$ qmake
	$ mingw32-make
