(in approximative priority order)

- When a CalculationWidget is focused, tab goes to the next one, shift+tab to the previous.
- Add a lot of shortcuts, the application should be usable without any mouse
- "copy" ability on the output of a calculation, returning the text-giac-like result
- Designing the application (a lot) : icons and stuff
- Tooltips displaying GIAC help messages about functions
- Lot of wizards to insert matrix, specific functions, â€¦
