(in approximative priority order)

(1) - Allow O(1) identification of currently focused CalculationWidget
[IN PROGRESS - REQUIRES (1)] - Ensure the focused CalculationWidget is still visible when text is replaced by TeX 
[REQUIRES (1)] - When a CalculationWidget is focused, tab goes to the next one, shift+tab to the previous.
- Add a lot of shortcuts, the application should be usable without any mouse
- "copy" ability on the output of a calculation, returning the text-giac-like result
- Designing the application (a lot) : icons and stuff
- Tooltips displaying GIAC help messages about functions
- Refuse to compute empty expression
- Lot of wizards to insert matrix, specific functions, â€¦
